Feature: Person Detection and Face Recognition - Elderly Care Centre Use
	
	In order to identify the different people around the elderly center
	As a SocialRobot
	I need to perform face recognition, while moving around
	
	Background:
		Given SocialRobot moves around the elderly center
		And the light conditions will be different in distinct divisions of the building
	
	Scenario: Person Detection and Face recognition in good light
		Given the robot is moving around detecting people using the haar like features algorithm
		And the robot is crossing a division with ambient ligth ranging between 200-350 luxes
		When the robot selects haar like features algorithm to detect people in its way
		And the robot selects haar like features algorithm to detect faces
		And the robot selects eigenfaces algorithm to identify the person
		Then the robot should identify the person

	Scenario: Person Detection and Face recognition in dimmed light
		Given the robot is moving around detecting people using the haar like features algorithm
		And the robot is crossing a division with ambient light is below 200-350 luxes
		When the robot selects hog like features algorithm to detect people in its way
		And the robot selects haar like features algorithm to detect faces
		And the robot selects eigenfaces algorithm to identify the person
		Then the robot should identify the person
